        <h2>Blog</h2>

        <p>On my blog, I share my thoughts on the latest web development trends, tips and tricks, and also some project of my training toward web development.

        For example, this website is one of my project. The description of the steps is write below. First, based on the html basic syntaxes I designed a “fave-icon” to make it look good and exciting. Second, to cativate the attention of the visitor, I add  on the header a special red-bull picture.

        I wrote a breave description about myself, and  my journey. Then the website ask the visitor to sign in when he is an existing user, and give option to reset the password by clicking on “forgot password". For new user, they have option to sign up by creating their account.

        </p>

        <p>My journey as a eager web developer can be describe with 3 word: learning, curious, excausted. First, I wake up every morning, take my breakfast then jump behind my laptop.  The first step I do is to set a goal for the day, make some research then work on it. 2h before the meeting started, aI make a short review of what the meeting will be about, tryng to fit myself with the contents in order to have a better understanding when it come to the professor to explain. After the meeting, I usually make excercice and projects due.

        So far, I learn the basic syntax of the web page using HTML and his elements, I’m able to create a web page but limited to the intereaction with the document object. I’m discovering everyday a lot of tricks that make sometime look smart but Im fully confident that it will be a long hard day to go. Sometime, run out of ideas, out of competences, out of search about projects… but I stand and when it come to finish it I fill relaxed and satisfied.
